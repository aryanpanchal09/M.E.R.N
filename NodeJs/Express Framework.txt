Build Server
------------
const express = require('express');
const app = express(); - contain all the function of express function 
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
})

app.listen(port, () => { - () callback function  - function()
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
})

To Stop the server - Ctrl + C * 2(twice)
Every application has it's own port number on which it's running
localhost - own machine 
3000 - port number

To get some response from the server we are going to use get
/ - by default will take you to the home page
app.get("/", function(req, res){ - default parameters which we have to give 
  res.send('Hello World!'); - by default function 
})
