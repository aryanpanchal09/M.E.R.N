Authentication - Process of identifying an individual, usually based on a username, password, and some type of additional verification 

Whisper App Project 

Schema basically tells what type of data we are going to store in our mongodb database

Encrypt-Password 
----------------

npm i moongoose-encryption

const encrypt = require('mongoose-encryption');

MD5 - Password encrypt 

We have to create a key then using the schema we are going to encrypt the password


const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/secrets");
const trySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    email: String,
    password: String
});

const secret = "thisislittlesecret";
trySchema.plugin(encrypt,{secret:secret,encryptedFields:["password"]});

Password is encrypted
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("66f224a60416bb015d1a36d9"),
    "email" : "aryantech23@gmail.com",
    "_ct" : BinData(0, "YUDZ0CG8ED8RCnSqR+qHmD1Ud4PFvYKltzkvck2Q1lJcZENPDp3Z2ClPHFdSRHycuQ=="),
    "_ac" : BinData(0, "YRNNC9IadIWlV1BvuHtFqdyoLZ7pfivJz8RpxXozutrwWyJfaWQiLCJfY3QiXQ=="),
    "__v" : NumberInt(0),
    "password" : ""
}
