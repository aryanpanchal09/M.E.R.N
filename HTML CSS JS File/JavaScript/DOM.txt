DOM stands for Document Object Model 

UseCase
. How to make our Webpage Interactive
. How to change some content Dynamically on a Webpage

HTML Tree Generator -> HTML Extension 

Console - Document --> complete Webpage
1st Child of the Document/Web Page - HTML Tag

document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild
body - answer // last child 
html - answer // first child 

To get the last child from the Webpage / Document
To get the paragraph 
document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild
<p>paragraph</p>


So that we don't have to write this much line of code again and again that's why we are storing it in a variable
var a = document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild;
undefined
a.innerHTML = "good bye";
"good bye" -> Content website change

Naming Conventions for Variables 

Keywords that can't be used -> break boolean int //name correct
Should not start with number but can start with symbols such as _ //2name incorrect
Variable are Case Sensitive //_name correct

String concat

var x = string / decimal / integer / boolean / 

String = collection of characters 

var x = "string";
x
var y = "hello";
var z = "world";
console.log(y + z);
> hello world 

Length Property in Strings 

var arr2 = "findouthowmanycharactersarethereinthisline";

arr2.length;

// Program to get Length of Array Given by User

var arr = prompt();

arr.length;

# Slicing in Strings 

var pc = "Random String";
pc // Print the Content
pc.slice(0,4); // always start from 0

# Changing Case of String 

var c = "This is c String"
c
c.toUpperCase();
var d = c.toUpperCase();
d.toLowerCase();

# Types of Operator in Javascript

Operator -> With the help of Operator we perform Operations
2 + 2 = 4 -> 2 + 2 is Operator and 4 is Operation

Types 
. Arithmetic 
+
-
*
/
%  - Modulus (Divison Remainder)
++ - Increment
-- - Decrement


. Comparison
Used for Checking Condition alternative to if else statement 


. Logical  * Most Important 
|| (OR) -> result = a || b -> Only One Condition needs to be True
&& (AND) -> Both the Condition needs to be true otherwise it will be False 
  ++ = +
  -- = -
  -+ = -
  -- = -

. Assignment
=  - x = y
+= - x = x + y
-= - x = x - y
*= - x = x * y
/= - x = x / y
%= - x = x % y
**= - x = x ** y

. Conditional

// Notebook Javascript Console Functions 

Object - real world entity that has some Property and Behaviour Ex Car
Class - Blueprint
Properties - Car Properties
Method - car.start()

var person = {
  firstName: "How",
  lastName: "Do You Do",
  age: 50,
  eyecolor: "blue"
};
person["eyecolor]

Method Declare 

  fullName: function(){
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }

  person.fullName();
